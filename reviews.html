                Took my 2011 Nissan Sentra in to get the windows done back in  late 2010, Steve did a great job. Was done in about an hour, I had that car for  almost 3yrs never had a problem. Just got a upgrade and I have already  scheduled my appointment with Steve so he can work his magic on the window of  my 2013 Sentra. I wouldn't go anywhere else! Need your windows done give Steve  a call!<br>

                  In 2005 I was looking for a place to tint the windows on my new  Dodge Dakota. A friend of mine recommended Tint Pros and I was not  disappointed! Steve is very knowledgeable about the various types of tint  available and gives you all of the options up front; the price he quotes is the  price you pay. Since then I have brought 5 vehicles to Tint Pros and recommend  them to all of my friends and family. If you are looking for the best tint job  in town then look no further than Tint Pros!<br>

                  Nice guy, keeps you updated with any changes. I've done my 1999  Nissan pathfinder, 2006 Chrysler 300, and 1999 Mitsubishi mirage there. They  all cost me under $200 and they all came out perfect. Highly recommended.  Nathan Morin<br>

                  I just had my Camry se 2010 done at this place. I was deceived  from the outside of the shop. Went in. Had a great service from the owner  Steve. Very honest and conservative. I got to watch how he put on the ceramic  tint. I totally felt a peace about this service. He makes his job look easy and  artistic. Reasonable price compared to the other places. Thanks Steve!<br>

                  I looked for a new Tint place after the one I used previously  kept giving me the run around when it came to setting up appointments. Thats  when I found Steve @ TintPros. He carries a great verity of films and prices  everything very fairly. I have now had over 7 cars done with him and no regrets  anytime. In fact Im here writing their review as I was looking up their number  on Google to get my 8th car done there.<br>

                  I've just had all the windows tinted on my old 1996 Saab 900S at  Tint Pros for a reasonable price and in 1-1/2 hours...exactly what was quoted.  The windows look terrific and my car looks beautiful. Steve is a knowledgable  professional who answered all my questions and treated me fairly. I will bring  my other cars to Tint Pros and recommend them to anyone looking for a great  auto-tint place. David Schwartz - Henderson.<br>

                  Most of September was spent researching window tinting shops and  types of films. Since I lived close to Tint Pro's near Sunset and the U.S. 95 I  dropped by and talked to Steve the owner! He spent valuable time going over the  various tints and applications available. He showed me his State of the Art,  Cutting edge computer cutter that cut the films to the exact specifications. As  I watched him finish another customers car, I was extremely impressed by the  quality and careful installation of the film. Having been in the industry for  over 35 years, it was easy to see why Tint Pro's is used by several City and  County Agencies for their tinting needs. I was explained all the Nevada state  laws, shades and types of films including the new Nano-technology that has  recently hit the markets. Steve was very personable in explaining the various  safety advantages and needs for the various films. Scheduling and completion  times where spot on! I had both mine and my wife's Mercedes tinted and my  daughters new BMW as well. Upon completion of the Vehicles, Steve also  explained how he has saved customers hundreds of dollars a year by applying the  Window Films to their homes and office buildings reducing electric bills and  adding privacy. All around a wonderful Experience! I'll recommend Tint Pro's to  all my friends and family. Five Stars for Tint Pro's Henderson. AL Lane<br>

              <li class="style7">I had a  great experience with Tinting my windows here. &nbsp;Before actually coming  here to get my windows tinted, I had called around to get some price quotes.  &nbsp;Tintpros is competitive on their prices, and seemed to be cheaper than  the other quotes I got. &nbsp;This time around for my new car I was looking to  getting ceramic tinting done. &nbsp;It is a bit more expensive, and when summer  time comes around, I'll really know whether it was all worth the extra $115.  &nbsp;I decided to go this route so my car doesn't have to work as hard to cool  the inside, PLUS I have black interior.&nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                I called one morning to see if Tintpros had any open availability the same day,  and Stephen said that if I brought in my car now (830am), he should be able to  squeeze me in, in case of a no show. &nbsp;I managed to drop the car by 12:00pm  after running a few errands. &nbsp;It was a bit out of my way, and a bit hard  to find. &nbsp;The location of TintPros is not too far from the 95 past the  Galleria mall. &nbsp;When you find the sign, it is easiest when you pull up  from the back. &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                Luckily, he was not working at a car at that time, so he was able to run me  through the selections that I could choose. &nbsp;He has the tint posted in the  office on a wall, showing the differences in shades that you can select.  &nbsp;I've tinted my windows dark before (too dark of visibility), so its  really helpful to have the actual tint in comparison to each other. &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                I asked him about the difference in the Ceramic technology to the standard  tint, and he even had a display for that too. &nbsp;He had the HQ and the  Ceramic tint next to each other, you put your hand on the glass, and on the  other end he had a Halogen lamp, then you put your hand against the glass.  &nbsp;You can actually feel the heat difference. &nbsp;After that test, I was  sold on getting the ceramic tinting. &nbsp;I picked the 10%, it looks like the  tint of 35% of the HQ tint. &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                After just a few hours, my car was ready. &nbsp;Stephen gave me the run down,  the warranty, etc. &nbsp;I took a look at my car, and barely saw any noticebly  bubbles to keep my eye out on. &nbsp;Every tint place will say it will go away  over time, Tintpros didn't have to say that because the tint was superb.  &nbsp;He even wiped down the car so that I don't have the noticeable water  marks on my car. &nbsp;<br>
                <br>
                I've mentioned Stephen's name throughout the review, he is the owner, he does  the tint himself. &nbsp;A young kid is not doing the tint, so no mess in or out  of the car, no stinky aroma of body odor in your car (its happened to me, and  hello?! you can't air out your car by rolling down the windows!). &nbsp;His  years of experience shows in his workmanship, he is courteous and helpful, and  if I have another car to tint, I'm for sure giving him my business. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

About 30 minutes later, he was done  and he did a TERRIFIC job! Tint matched my back windows flawlessly. &nbsp;Don't  hesitate to bring your vehicle in.</li>
